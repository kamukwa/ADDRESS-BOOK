## 🧪 Business Logic Tests

All business logic was built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.  
Here’s the business logic that was tested:

### Contact Object
- ✅ Creates a contact with a name, email, phone, and address.

### AddressBook Object
- ✅ Adds a contact to the address book.
- ✅ Removes a contact from the address book.
- ✅ Lists all contacts.

Tests were written manually by checking functionality through UI actions:
- After adding, the contact appears on the list.
- After double-clicking, the contact is removed.

1. Fill out the contact form.
2. Click **Add Contact** to save a new contact.
3. Click on a contact name to view full details.
4. Double-click on a contact to delete it from your address book.
